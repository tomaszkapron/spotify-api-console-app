## Description
This is a project where I learnt how to work with WEB API's and to work with OAuth2 protocol. This application connects to Spotify account throught API, and let you interact with basic endpoints, providing you links and basic information about your account.

## Installation
Clone repository
```
  git clone https://github.com/tomaszkapron/spotify-api-console-app
```

Build and run (If working on Windows use gradlew.bat scripts instead)
```
  gradlew build
  gradlew run
```

Before first run of the program, clientID and clientSecret needs to be provided  in Config.java file.

**NOTE:** ClientSecret should not be keept as a plaintext in the code. It is done for simplicity and provided secret is not valid.

## Usage

 The following commands can be used to navigate in console:

- new - a list of new albums with artists and links on Spotify
- featured - a list of Spotify-featured playlists with their links fetched from API
- categories - a list of all available categories on Spotify (just their names)
- playlists <CATEGORY_NAME> - where CATEGORY_NAME is the name of category. The list contains playlists of this category and their links on Spotify
- auth - perform user authetication **FIRST COMMAND TO RUN AS IT MAKES ALL THE OTHER COMMANDS AVAILABLE**
- next - navigates to next page
- prev -navigates to previous page
- exit - shuts down the application

## Sample output
